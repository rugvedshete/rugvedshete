# Hi there 👋, I’m Rugved Shete  

### 🔭 I’m a Quant / Algorithmic-Trading Enthusiast  
I build end-to-end trading & quant-finance projects using Python, machine learning, and market data — from simple SMA backtests to HFT-style simulations.

## 🧰 Tech Stack  

- **Data & Analysis**: Python · Pandas · NumPy · yfinance / Yahoo Finance  
- **Trading & Backtesting**: backtesting.py, custom scripts (pairs trading, market-making)  
- **Machine Learning / DL**: scikit-learn · TensorFlow / Keras · LSTM / Time-Series Modeling  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Version Control & Hosting**: Git · GitHub

## 🚀 Featured Projects  

| Project | What it does / Why it stands out |
|--------|-----------------------------------|
| **SMA-Crossover Backtesting (NSE)** | Classic moving-average strategy backtest with real Indian stock data — helps understand execution & returns. |
| **Market-Making Simulator (NSE)** | Simulates HFT-style bid/ask quoting, spread-capture & inventory risk — microstructure-level awareness. |
| **Stat-Arb Pairs Trading (Cointegration)** | Cointegration-based stat-arb between banking stocks, market-neutral, good mean-reversion P&L. |
| **Order-Book Imbalance Prediction (LSTM)** | Uses 5-min candle data + LSTM to predict next-bar direction with ~60% accuracy — shows ML + finance merge. |
